# SOM

this is the project of our Capstone project.

This program is coded in kotlin, so you can use this app in android mobile.

There are a few things to be aware of before using it.

1. After you sign up, in the first log in, press the log in button and please wait a second.
   Then the dialog will appear. Join group or make group. If you press log in button twice, you will enter the app without group.
   If so, it is recommended to log out and then log in again. User not has group can't use content usefully.
   
2. This app's recording have to make groupmate. So if you want test our app, we will give the id,password of test data.
   1) id: test7@gmail.com / password: test77
   2) id: mh99122118@gmail.com / password:q12345
   they are group mate. so test this app by using Emulator & phone with this account.
   The account contains dummy data that we used while developing, so you can refer to it.
   
3. this app is using firebase, storage when saving photo and text.
   Therefore, photos may take some time to load. Please wait a second.
   
4. when you click the date before 12/6, app can stop. Because the algorithm is changed, but the data is remaining in database.
   As a result, the application may crash due to the process of loading data that does not match the current algorithm.
